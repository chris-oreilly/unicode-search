Search for unicode characters by name.

Usage:
```
./unicode-search.py black star -light -medium -heavy
```

It will print a list of matching code points, e.g.
```
â˜…	2605	BLACK STAR
âœ¦	2726	BLACK FOUR POINTED STAR
âœ«	272B	OPEN CENTRE BLACK STAR
âœ¬	272C	BLACK CENTRE WHITE STAR
âœ­	272D	OUTLINED BLACK STAR
âœ´	2734	EIGHT POINTED BLACK STAR
âœ¶	2736	SIX POINTED BLACK STAR
âœ·	2737	EIGHT POINTED RECTILINEAR BLACK STAR
âœ¹	2739	TWELVE POINTED BLACK STAR
â­‘	2B51	BLACK SMALL STAR
ðŸŸ‚	1F7C2	THREE POINTED BLACK STAR
ðŸŸ†	1F7C6	FOUR POINTED BLACK STAR
```

I created this so that I could have search functionality right in the terminal,
without having to open google.
